# About Me

I am currently a third-year college student studying programming on the side. I am developing several note-taking templates that can be used by anyone.

You might ask:

1. Template for what?
	- Template for professional note taking programs like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Anytype](https://anytype.io/), and [Capacities](https://capacities.io/).
2. Are those programs for free?
	- Yes, all of those programs are free. Although, there are some features or services that are only accessible through paywalls, they are not essential. In fact, I have never used any of those features or services, and I'm still able to utilize the programs to their full capacity.
3. Can you provide tutorials for using these programs?
	- As a student, I can't really focus on other things too much but I can create video tutorials on those topics in the future. For now, you can contact me [here](https://www.facebook.com/Cameron.Black2003) if you have any concerns about this.
